Have you ever experience identity fraud like I have?
IF (yes), then:
1) Sit there
2) Contemplate as to why you thought NeoPets required your Social Security #.  

IF (no), then:
1) Take out a piece of paper
2) Take out a pen
3) Write down your government-related I.D. or SSN. This is your “art work”. Present
it in a way that is aesthetically pleasing. However, to protect your identity, please write down any range of single-digit numbers that fulfills your interest in deterring potential-fraud.
4)Learn a valuable life lesson and make art.
